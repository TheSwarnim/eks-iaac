# It is recommended to specify a block that does not overlap with resources in other networks that are peered or connected to our VPC. The block must meet the following requirements:

# Within one of the following private IP address blocks: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, or 192.168.0.0/16.
# Doesnâ€™t overlap with any CIDR block assigned to the VPC that you selected for VPC.
# Between /24 and /12.
serviceIpv4Cidr: 172.20.0.0/16 # aws by default can specify custom cidr either this or 10.100.0.0/16
